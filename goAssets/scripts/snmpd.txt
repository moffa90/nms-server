# First, map the community name (COMMUNITY) into a security name
# (local and mynetwork, depending on where the request is coming
# from):

#               sec.name        source          community
com2sec         paranoid        default         public
com2sec         read            default         {{.ReadString}}
com2sec         write           default         {{.WriteString}}

####
# Second, map the security names into group names:

#     group.name        sec.model	sec.name
group publicGroup       v1              paranoid
group publicGroup       v2c             paranoid
group publicGroup       usm             paranoid

group readGroup         v1              read
group readGroup         v2c             read
group readGroup         usm             read

group writeGroup        v1              write
group writeGroup        v2c             write
group writeGroup        usm             write

####
# Third, create a view for us to let the groups have rights to:

#           incl/excl subtree                          mask
view all    included  .1                               80
view system included  .iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.system

####
# Finally, grant the 2 groups access to the 1 view with different
# write permissions:

#                       context sec.model   sec.level   match   read    write  notif
access publicGroup	    ""	    any         noauth      exact   system  none   none
access readGroup        ""	    any         noauth      exact   all     none   none
access writeGroup       ""	    any         noauth      exact   none     all    none
